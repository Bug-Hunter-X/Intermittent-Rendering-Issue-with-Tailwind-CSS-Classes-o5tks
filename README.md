# Intermittent Rendering Issue with Tailwind CSS Classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using certain Tailwind CSS classes. The issue is characterized by unexpected rendering behavior or unexpected behaviour in specific browsers. The issue is intermittent and doesn't always occur on the first render of the page.  This often manifests as elements not rendering correctly, or styles applying inconsistently. 

## Bug Description

The bug involves using a combination of Tailwind classes that leads to inconsistent rendering across browsers or even across multiple renders within the same browser. The specific problematic classes may vary. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server. 
4. Observe the rendering of the component. You might need to refresh the page multiple times to see the inconsistent behavior.

## Potential Causes

- **Conflicting Styles:** Possible conflicts between Tailwind CSS styles and other CSS frameworks or custom CSS rules could be a factor. 
- **Browser Caching/Rendering:**  Browser caching mechanisms or rendering inconsistencies might play a role in the intermittent nature of the bug. 
- **Tailwind CSS Version:** Issues might be tied to specific versions of Tailwind CSS. 

## Solution

The solution may involve identifying the conflicting styles and refactoring them, ensuring that Tailwind is applied consistently and correctly. It's also vital to carefully inspect browser dev tools and network requests to diagnose the problem and ensure that the styles are being loaded and applied correctly. In some cases, upgrading Tailwind CSS or checking for conflicting plugins might be the solution.
