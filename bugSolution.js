//Ensure that your Tailwind configuration is correct and up-to-date
//Check for any conflicting CSS rules. Using browser developer tools helps to identify those
//If possible, try to reproduce the bug in a simplified environment to isolate the problem.
//Consider using the purge functionality of Tailwind to optimize your CSS and remove unused styles which can help resolve the issue.
//Make sure you're not using too many classes that may trigger this issue. Simplifying the class structures might resolve the issue.
//Try upgrading Tailwind CSS to the latest version.

// Example of how you might debug and resolve a specific instance
//In this example, we assume the shadow was not working on specific browsers.
//If this is an issue, consider adding a vendor prefix to ensure compatibility across browsers.
//Replace `shadow-md` with a more general approach.
